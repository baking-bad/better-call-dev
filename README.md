### No more nested data structures
(Pair (Pair)) is a Tuple, (Or (Or)) is an Enum.

### Feel the full power of annotations
After all, they must be of some use.

### Human-readable types
No need to convert timestamps or amounts, lists, sets and maps are represented in the json format.

### BigMap diffs
At last!

## We need your assistance
If you find a smart-contract that is displayed incorrect please create an issue, we will fix it!

## Acknowledgments
We are very grateful to the OCamlPro team for the TzScan API on which our project is based. Cheer for you guys!
